# Data analysis
Whole data analysis including modelling part is presented in jupyter notebook.
# Model
Model.py is just a snipet of code from jupyter notebook presenting just a modelling stage
Because of that there are 2 missing arrays: x_train and y_train - to use this snipet user need to intialize those 2 manually
But its highly recommended to use notebook instead, where the full data analysis is presented
Best model was chosen using the RMSE target metric. In this case it was RandomForestRegressor.
# Predictions
All predictions are exported into predictions.csv file.
